This is a placeholder README for the 'yvc' utility.

'yvc' is a software package vulnerability checker.

'yvc' compares the given package name against the list of known
vulnerabilities and reports any security issues. This output contains the
name and version of the package, the type of vulnerability, and a URL for
further information for each vulnerable package.

'yvc' was conceptually based on NetBSD's audit-packages program (see
http://www.netbsd.org/support/security/#check-pkgsrc) and was written by
Jan Schaumann <jschauma@netmeister.org> at Yahoo! Inc.

The 'y' in yvc can stand for a number of things.  Make up your own.

'yvc' will be made available to the world at large in the very exciting
and very near future.
